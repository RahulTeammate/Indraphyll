#TextTreeSection===============================

Welcome! This tutorial txt file teaches you how to 
write dialogues for a TextTreeSection (Conversation Tree).
Let's begin!

[80]Before we start, make sure to read section_tutorial1.txt first.

[50]First, each TextTreeSection Node has a TextSeqSection (Wall of Text),
that doesn't activate a Checkpoint after its dialogues finish outputting.
[80]In other words, each Node can have dialogues of varying text
scroll lag.

[100]Second, notice how in line 3, "100" in brackets has a newline separation 
from its dialogue. This notation needs to be preserved for the FIRST dialogue
of each TextTreeSection Node.

[100]Third, the "end of file" rule from TextSeqSection applies here.

[250]Fourth, to make the game load these dialogues as 
a TextTreeSection (Conversation Tree), get this file's filename,
[100]go to section_types.txt and create a newline. 
In that newline,
write "filename TextTreeSection N/A".

[100]Finally, let us talk about how this txt file will save the TextTreeSection
(Conversation Tree) Structure. 
[200]This node's indra child will first output A.
This node's phil child will first output B.

[200]This node's indra child will first output C.
This node's phil child will first output D.

[200]We will spawn a Checkpoint here with the following notation.

D
[200]We will spawn a Game Over here with the following notation.

[200]This node's indra child will first output E.
This node's phil child will first output F.
