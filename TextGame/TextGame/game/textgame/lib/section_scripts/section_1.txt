[150]This tale begins three hundred years ago...
[100]A ferocious storm swept through the northern continent,
burning, flooding, quaking, and electrocuting everything in sight.

Within the destruction, emerged a young man of radiant blue hair.
His name was Indra.

Indra declared that he was the Warrior-God of Lightning
in human form. That he was on a Quest to preserve the world.
But all who heard him knew him as "Indra the Insane".

With no one to join him, Indra journeyed far and wide until he
spotted a guild. It was the Heroes Guild, a guild that promised
mercenaries to any Hero, no matter how unbelievable their Quest was.

Excited, Indra entered the Heroes Guild, only to find that 
all of its mercenaries were taken, and he had no money to pay them anyways.

It was then that a mercenary no one else took emerged from the back room.
That mercenary had blue hair as well, slinging Pom Poms over his shoulder.

His name was Phil, and he was excited to find a Hero who needed a mercenary
when he was the only one left. Indra[300]... [100]did not share that sentiment, to say
the least.

But it became clear to Indra that no mercenary in the world would join a Hero
without money upfront. This[300]... [100]one was willing to be paid after he finished his Quest.

Very, very reluctantly, Indra accepted the mercenary who stated that his best skill
was to cheer a Hero to the very end. Together, Indra and Phil left the guild
into the open world.

This is a tale of a God[300]... [100]and his cheerleader.

[0]Indra
[150]*pant* *pant* [100]...They said that this human town was this way.
Where is it?

[0]Phil
[100]Come on, Indra. We can't be far now!

[0]Phil
[100]Let's go, Indra! One step, two step~! One step, two step~! One-

[0]Indra
[75]Grrrr! [90]Why must you irritate me so? At least keep your mouth
shut while we travel!

[0]Phil
[100]But you seem to be moving faster. My cheers must be working!

[0]Indra
[100]No[300]... [75]I move faster to get away from your shrilly voice!

[0]Indra (thinking)
[100]Sigh[300]... [100]Once we earn some money, I will send this lump back home and 
get a REAL group of mercenaries.

[0]Phil
[100]Hey, look! That has to be the town!

[0]Indra
[75]What? [100]Oh, finally. When Gods struggle with these distances, why do humans
build their towns so far away?

[0]Phil
[75]Weeeeeell[300]... [100]We have fast ships and all, but we don't have money for them.

[0]Indra
[300]...

[0]Phil
[100]Is something wrong, Indra?

[0]Indra
[60]I will not hear about our "lack-of" anything anymore!

[0]Phil
[60]Eeeep! Ok! Ok!

[100]And so, Indra and Phil enter the town. Bustling with commerce
and children running around[300]... [100]it is not.

It is eerily silent, with the wind and nearby sea making the most
noise. [150]As Indra and Phil wander around, they see[300]...

[0]Phil
[60]Oh my goodness!

[0]Indra
[100]This town has been attacked.

[75]From the center of the town, Indra and Phil see ransacked and squashed
buildings all the way up to the nearby mountains. As they walk around, 
some loud and anxious voices are heard from one of the buildings still standing.

[0]Indra
[100]There must be some humans inside.
Let us ask them what happened.

[100]As Indra and Phil enter the building, they see a plump man sweating with worry, 
bargaining with three mercenaries. Those three are wearing bandanas with a skull
and crossbones on them.

[0]???
[75]I'm so grateful you three came here!
[75]I will give you 2000 gold if you can slay that demon!

[0]Mercenary 1
[100]Did you hear that? [60]2000 gold!

[0]Mercenary 2
[100]Towns ransacked by demons always give the best price, hm?

[0]Indra
[100]2000 gold? Price? What are they talking about, Phil?

[0]Phil
[75]Money! If those three can slay that demon, they're going
to get lots of money!

[0]Indra
[75]M[300]...[75]money?!

[0]Indra (thinking)
[75]Yes! I can slay the demon, collect the money, and be one step closer
in ditching this dreg!

[0]Indra
[50]Phil! [100]We will slay the demon ourselves and get that money!

[100]As Indra rushes toward the four of them, Phil grabs Indra and pulls him back.

[0]Indra
[75]What are you doing, Phil?!

[0]Phil
[75]We can't just take those three mercenaries' jobs, Indra!

[0]Indra
[75]And why not? 

[0]Phil 
[75]Those three are from the Skull Guild. I've heard many bad things about them.
People say they violently kill anyone that gets in their way of making money...

[0]Indra
[100]Hmph. Well, I think I can handle speaking to humans.

[0]Phil
[100]Waaait!
