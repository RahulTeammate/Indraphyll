#TextSeqSection================================
[100]Welcome! This tutorial txt file teaches you how to 
write dialogues for a TextSeqSection (Wall of Text).
Let's begin!

[75]First, this dialogue has a text scroll lag of 75 milliseconds. 
In other words, each character of this dialogue is outputted every 75 milliseconds.
[50]Next, this dialogue has a text scroll lag of 50 milliseconds.
[0]But THIS dialogue has no text scroll lag. 
In other words, all of this dialogue is printed in one go.

[125]Second, let us talk about newlines in the dialogue. 
This sentence will be on a new line when outputted.
So will this sentence.
[200]And so will this one, even though this dialogue has a different text scroll lag.

[100]Third, you may have noticed the three empty lines up to now.
The game will output those empty lines. The first empty line has a text scroll lag
of 100 ms, the second one has a text scroll lag of 0 ms, and the third has a
text scroll lag of 200 ms.

[88]Fourth, DO NOT use brackets in this file's dialogues. It will cause the 
ReadFromTxtFile() function in TextSeqSection.cpp to break.

[250]Fifth, to make the game load these dialogues as 
a TextSeqSection (Wall of Text), get this file's filename,
[100]go to section_types.txt and create a newline. 
In that newline,
write "filename TextSeqSection true" 
if you want a Checkpoint to occur after the dialogues finish outputting.
Write "filename TextSeqSection false"
if you don't want a Checkpoint to occur after the dialogues finish outputting.

[100]Finally, make sure to put an "end of file" string surrounded with brackets 
at the end of this file. That way, the ReadFromTxtFile() function knows it has
reached the end of this file.

[200]This tutorial is done! Enjoy making dialogue!
